Notes on data merging (FAOSTAT + Climate)
-------------------------------------------
1. FAOSTAT provides country-year crop yield and production data. Use 'Area harvested' and 'Yield' columns.
2. Align climate data (World Bank, CRU, or NOAA station aggregated) by country and year or by coordinates.
3. Aggregate climate into growing-season windows (planting->harvest) -- cumulative precipitation, mean temp.
4. Ensure consistent country identifiers (ISO3) to merge datasets reliably.
